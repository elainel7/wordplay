Style your text

Sometimes we want our text to stand out. We can do this by /italicizing/, *bolding*, and more!

For example, to italicize text, you can wrap it in forward slashes //, like //Hello//. For example:

\
Scene([
  Phrase(`This is normal text`)
  Phrase(`/This is italicized text/`)
])
\

@Scene can also bold text. You can do this by wrapping your text in asterisks **, like **Hello**. For example:

\
Scene([
  Phrase(`This is normal text`)
  Phrase(`*This is bolded text*`)
])
\

@Scene can also make text EXTRA bold. For this, wrap your text with carets ^^, like ^^Hello^^. For example:

\
Scene([
  Phrase(`This is normal text`)
  Phrase(`^This is extra bolded text^`)
])
\

Finally, @Scene can make text underlined. For this, wrap your text in underscores __, like __Hello__. For example:

\
Scene([
  Phrase(`This is normal text`)
  Phrase(`_This is underlined text_`)
])
\
