Layer images over each other

Sometimes we want to layer images over each other to create cool scenes and shapes. 

For example, we can use multiple layers in your project on @Stage to stack and manipulate images.

Look! Here's a turtle that I made using shapes!

¶Note: Check out the gallery for another project <example@https://wordplay.dev/project/example-Layers?play> of layering images.¶


Stage(
	[
		Shape(Circle(3m 0m 1m 0m))
		Shape(Circle(2m 0m -11m 0m))
		Shape(Polygon(7m 6 0m -6m 0m))
		Shape(Rectangle(-11m -9m 11m -12m 10m) rotation: 25°)
		Shape(Rectangle(-11m -9m 11m -12m 10m) rotation: -25°)

	]
	place: Place(0m 10m -30m)
)

You could make some really cool stuff with layers! Try it out!
